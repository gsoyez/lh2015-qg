Deductor 1.0.2
There are two directories: parton and hadron.
Each contains two files for electron-positron annihilation 
at sqrt(s) = 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 GeV.
One is for a hard process that produces just up + upbar.
The other is for a hard process that produces just two gluons.

The parton level results are generated with Deductor with the LC+ approximation for color. 

The hadron level results are generated by Deductor with the LC (leading color) approximation. These events were passed to Pythia 8.212 for hadronization. The hadronized events were then passed to Rivet to make graphs. (I used the leading color approximation in Deductor because it is a little complicated to make string states from quantum states beyond the leading color approximation and we do not have code for that yet.)

Deductor is a dipole shower with virtuality based ordering. It uses a color aproximation that goes beyond leading color (LC), namely the LC+ approximation. This includes some -- but certainly not all -- corrections to order 1/N_c^4. However, I find that there is no substantial difference for the observables considered between LC and LC+. Rather, differences with other parton shower algorithms presumably come from a different ordering variable, different splitting functions, and a different recoil scheme.

I have added two hard processes, for e+ e- to u + ubar and e+ e- to g + g, to Deductor 1.0.2 for this study.
