	* MC_LHQG_Zjet.cc (Rivet):
	Set the cut to 5GeV after discussion w Philippe

2017-03-07  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* MC_LHQG_Zjet.cc (Rivet):
	The Boson cut was actually applied on the muons!  Changed this to
	Impose a looser cut on the leptons and then then teh appropriate
	cut on the -boson pt.

	* MC_LHQG_Zjet.cc:             *** ADDED ***
	* MC_LHQG_dijet.cc:            *** ADDED ***
	added preliminary verasions of the pp analyses
	compared to their ee equivalent:
	- they use the same observables (using pt,DeltaR instead of E,angle)
	- they directly target physics processes, either Z+jet or dijet
	  with no flavour specified initially
	- the cuts change and are slightly different in the two cases
	- we included measures on mMDT jets to have a feeling of the impact
