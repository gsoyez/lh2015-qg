Dear JHEP Typesetter,

Here are our responses to your query:

1.  Indeed, "that that" at the bottom of page 22 should be "that the".

2.  Here is the list of email addresses for all of the authors (note that Soyez's email is now changed):

philippe.gras@cern.ch
shoeche@slac.stanford.edu
deepak.kar@cern.ch
larkoski@reed.edu
leif.lonnblad@thep.lu.se
simon.platzer@durham.ac.uk
Andrzej.Siodmok@ifj.edu.pl
peter.skands@monash.edu
gregory.soyez@ipht.fr
jthaler@mit.edu

Also, for consistency with the umlauts in the other author names, please change the second author to:

Stefan H\"{o}che

3.  Yes, we are happy with the removal of [85] and including the additional figures as a supplement.  Because the figures changed slightly in the editorial process, we are attaching a new figures.zip file with the latest figures.  (The arXiv tex files are not needed in the supplement, just the pdf figures.)

Sincerely,
Gregory Soyez and Jesse Thaler (on behalf of the authors)
